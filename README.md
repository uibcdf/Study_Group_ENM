# Study Group

If you are visiting this group is because you need to learn about the gaussian or elastic
nework models of molecules.

Here we will share a rich list of scientific papers about the topic you must read and comment. How?
Have look to the next sections to find it out.

## How this study group works?

Two important thins you should know about the study group:

- Each student in this group will have a file with its name. This file will contain
a list of bibliographic references, a reading plan.

- Each scientific paper, read at least once by a member of the group, will have an issue opened in the
  "Issues board". This issue will contain the bibliographic reference, only in the openning post,
and a very brief summary and comment of each reader (between 4 and 12 lines, no more).

## Some rules to be all on the same page

- The file 'Name-of-student.md' has a tentative guide with a list of papers to be read in order. Week by week the file has
  to be updated if additional papers were read.

- After reading a document, the student will open a new issue in this repository with the corresponding document-keyword as title. The body of the first post in the issue will contain the bibliographic reference together with some few lines giving a breaf summary with those ideas the student wants to highlight. In addition, tags will be attached to the issue with those words describing the work reported in the document.

- Papers, proceedings, books, preprints, thesis... will be named with a key string: the citekey.
  Please follow [the rules of the UIBCDF regarding citekeys](https://github.com/uibcdf/Guidelines/blob/main/CiteKeys.md), there is a unique way to compose it from the bibliographic data of the item.

- Don't be shy to share ideas and doubts either in the issues board or
  in the discussions area. Having a written history of the learning process is a very good idea.

## Tips for the young researcher.

Is this your first research work? If you are at the begining of your scientific career, let us share with you some tips before you start your readings:

- The main purpose of this exercise is understanding, not just knowing.
- Keep in mind from day one the open questions you already have. Be smart to indentify where the
  answers could be from the first paper you read.
- Do not feel overwhelmed the first days. Avoid running crazy after every single doubt. Don't try to
  check every reference in your first paper.
- Write down in your list new questions and doubts. Long term, having many doubts it is more
  effective than having a lot of answers.
- Work first building a good and consistent structure of doubts.
- Work later in having a good and consistent conceptual story covering all your doubts. Fill the gaps reading, searching and thinking, as if it were a detective work. The mist will vanish with time.
- You will probably have hundreds of ideas: Why this question was not approached? Why this is not
  done? What would happen if...? Write down all these ideas, they are gold, they can be the seed of your future scientific contributions.
- Having a big collection of unread papers in your computer doesn't make you smart.
- Having a big collection of unread papers in your computer doesn't mean you understand the topic.
- Look for the meaning of the spanish word "adanismo". Do you really think is a good attitude to
  start a scientific career?
- Spend 10 minutes in internet looking for what the "Dunning-Kruger effect" is. Did you
  understand the plot confidence vs. knowledge? Where are you now? Where are you going to be in two weeks,
and in two years of digging into this topic?
- If you walk 1000 steps and just one, just a single step, any one, was random, you will have no idea where
  you are at the end of your walk. Do not guess anything. Do not assume anything. Do not advance in your research with out understanding every
move you did, every mistake or success you made.
- Enjoy learning. Enjoy suffering too.
- Don't be hasty.
- If, from the beginning, you think everything is simple, be 80% sure you didn't understand a word.
- If after being lost in the mist for along time, working hard to get some clarity, you come up
  with what you think is a too simple idea to be comunicated, be 80% sure you did a good job.
- If you are not enjoying when concepts begin to fall into place, maybe being a scientist won't make you happy.
- If you are not enjoying when you realize that what made sense yesterday doesn't make sense today, maybe being a scientist won't make you happy.

One last thing. This section is far from being a self-help guide. You can read about the following two empiric principles:

- Hofstadter's Law: "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law".
- Paretos Law: "80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes". Which means that 80% of your time and effort will produce only the 20% of your results.

And you can think: 'Aha... now that I know, I can do better'. Ok, let us tell you something. Let us dare to share with you a last piece of wisdom: no, you can't.

Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before." Jacob August Riis.

Be as stubborn as smart.
